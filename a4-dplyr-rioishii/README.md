The Data

The data for this challenge contains estimates for alcohol consumption
patterns at the U.S. county level each year from 2002 - 2012. More
specifically, for each county, the data represents the prevalence
(= drinkers/adult_population) of drinking in each
county. The two measures of interest are:

* Any Drinking: At least one drink of any alcoholic beverage in the past 30 days
* Binge Drinking: The consumption of more than four drinks for women or
five drinks for men on a single occasion at least once in the past 30
days

Estimates are provided for males and females separately, as well as
both sexes combined. The data comes from the
[Drinking-patterns study](http://www.healthdata.org/research-article/drinking-patterns-us-counties-2002-2012).

the same format. Note, there are estimates at the county, state, and
national level:
