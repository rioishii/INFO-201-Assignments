# User Documentation
This app allows users to select a brand of cereal and displays a bar graph of cereal ratings. Users can also filter the ratings of the cereal. For example, if a user wanted to only see cereal names that has a rating between 50 and 75, they can set the slider widget to min 50 and max 75. Lastly, the radio buttons can filter cold cereals or hot cereals.
