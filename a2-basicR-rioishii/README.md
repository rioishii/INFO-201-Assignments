# a2-core-skills

## Overview

In this assignment, you'll work through a set of tasks that require
knowledge of core concepts in R, and review your version control
skills. More specifically, you'll demonstrate the following
foundational skill sets:

* Managing a project using git and GitHub
* Creating variables of different types in R
* Writing and executing R functions
* Storing multiple elements in vectors

While the majority of the assignments in this course involve a deeper
dive into a particular dataset, this one has a bit more syntax
practice to make sure everyone is up to speed.

## Instructions

In this assignment, you'll complete the instructions in the
`assignment.R` file to demonstrate foundational skills of working with
R.  All the tasks are listed in comments in the file, you have to
write the corresponding code below the comments.  Your final version
of 'assignment.R' file **should be directly executable** in the sense
that it must be possible to source it, and it must run without errors
(see _source()_ function, and _Source_ in R-studio).

## Submission

Once you've finished editing your assignment.R file, use git to add
and commit the changes you've made, and push those changes to your
repository on GitHub.  I recommend to commit your changes not just
once but more frequently.  You may also want to check your files on
github and make sure all your changes are reflected there.

Please **submit the URL of your GitHub Repository**
as you assignment submission on Canvas.
